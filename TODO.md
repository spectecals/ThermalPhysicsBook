[X] start on ch4
[X] add answers to questions ch1,2

[/] - FOR DAFYDD
[/] thermometer figure 2.3, identify parts of thermometer with annotations
[/] fig of human breathing section 3.1
[/] redraw wall bounce section 3.1, rewrite caption without linebreaks
[/] draw cube with bouncing gas inside, section 3.1
[/] PV diagram of two isotherms, showing it's possible to move between isotherms by either increasing pressure OR volume (adiabatic vs isobaric), section 3.3
[/] [[FIG OF POINT PARTICLE WITH TRAJECTORIES IN X/Y/Z]]
[/] [[FIG OF BARBELLS SHOWING EACH TYPE OF TRANSLATION / ROTATION, SEE PG 25 FROM SAMER'S BREAKDOWN]]
[/] [[FIG OF CORKSCREW DIATOMIC MOLECULE SHOWING EACH TYPE OF TRANSLATION / ROTATION, SEE PG 25 FROM SAMER'S BREAKDOWN]]
[/] [[FIG OF ISOTHERM MOVING HORIZONTALLY VS VERTICALLY FOR VOLUME OR PRESSURE, BOTH SHOWING A CHANGE OF 1K BUT ONE SHOWING 12.5J VS ONE WITH 20.8J]]
[/] [[FIG 18 IN SRC]]
[/] [[FIG 8.1 IN SRC]]
[/] [[FIG 8.3 (sorry this one's a bit intense)]]
[/] [[FIG COMPRESSION IN SRC]]

[-] - UNDERWAY
[-] write up all questions in excel sheet with annotated from where

[O] - WONT DO YET
[O] add footnote for 3 states of matter vs 5
[O] incorporate jl's part of 3.properties of matter into 4.1, p vs V -- define states of matter, critical point, SHOW dont EXPLAIN isotherms
[O] section 2.3: include definitions of adiabatic, reversible processes, equilibrium
[O] add an equation for convection
[O] include q4 from jl (adiabatic comes later)

[ ] - TODO
[ ] "and the molecules are in their lowest energy state". what is meant here? end of diatomic molecule section
[ ] introduction of cp being cv + 2 isn't explained
[ ] "A phase is a portion of matter homogeneous in properties (e.g., liquid, vapour)" ?
[ ] fig 8.3 is a LOT of information that even I don't understand... I think we should go into a lot more detail if we're going to include this figure
[ ] [[REF FIG 8.3]]
[ ] add https://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node61.html from 8.5 onward to the end of 3.5
