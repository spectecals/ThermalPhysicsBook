[X] start on ch4
[X] add answers to questions ch1,2

[/] - FOR DAFYDD
[/] thermometer figure 2.3, identify parts of thermometer with annotations
[/] fig of human breathing section 3.1
[/] redraw wall bounce section 3.1, rewrite caption without linebreaks
[/] draw cube with bouncing gas inside, section 3.1

[-] - UNDERWAY
[-] write up all questions in excel sheet with annotated from where

[O] - WONT DO YET
[O] add footnote for 3 states of matter vs 5
[O] incorporate jl's part of 3.properties of matter into 4.1, p vs V -- define states of matter, critical point, SHOW dont EXPLAIN isotherms
[O] section 2.3: include definitions of adiabatic, reversible processes, equilibrium
[O] add an equation for convection
[O] include q4 from jl (adiabatic comes later)
