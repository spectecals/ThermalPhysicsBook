[x] - DONE
[X] right answer first for section 1 example (b)
[X] fig 17.17 in specific heat capacity section 3.2
[X] need to hyperlink with tags on earlier sections, ask gpt
[X] tag section 4.2 with section 1 ideal gases
[X] reformat fig17.17 up to example admonition to include everything incl plot in admonition
[X] full derivation of beta = 3alpha
[X] after 3.6 include smaer's section incl egg fig
[X] align equations
[X] adiabatic before 0th law --- NOTE: i've moved things around, included isothermal and isobaric alongside, removed internal energy as relates to kinetic theory in ch.4
[X] add newton's law of cooling in full from section 3 in JL
[X] do questions for ch1 and ch3, as many as possible from jonathan's, or from thermalphysics book
[X] get fig 1 fully worked
[X] example 3.5 fully worked out including math
[X] add phase diagram section text
[X] exapnd 3.8 intro
[X] add states of matter to section 3.7
[X] add fig 17.24 to section 3.8
[X] go back through referential sections from JL, include whole nb page
[X] section 3.8, include some examples of thermal conductivities
[X] remove plot backgrounds, png or likewise
[X] moving adiabatic ch.5, first law

[-] - UNDERWAY
[-] check whether to use \bar or \bra \ket notation - NOTE: underway, will do this later
[-] everything but the first law from ch.4JL heat and first law
[-] start on ch4
[-] write up all questions in excel sheet with annotated from where
[-] add answers to all questions (low prio)

[O] - WONT DO YET
[O] make a bunch of pv figs
[O] add footnote for 3 states of matter vs 5
[O] incorporate jl's part of 3.properties of matter into 4.1, p vs V -- define states of matter, critical point, SHOW dont EXPLAIN isotherms
[O] section 3.3: include definitions of adiabatic, reversible processes, equilibrium
[O] add an equation for convection

[] maybe plot, definitely example on sections 3.5-3.7
[] include q4 from jl
[] add to note on shc of water the difference in c_p for 0-100 and 0-40
[] thermometer figure 3.3, identify parts of thermometer with annotations
[] remove caption from thermometer fig
[] add linebreak back to 3.4
[] doublecheck 3.6 has been fully copied from JL 3.kelvin vs celsius
[] add "see figure ..." to egg figure caption
[] review chapter 2
[] invert states of matter and egg section, show solid liquid gas, phase diagram, mimic JL
[] figure out ordering for end of section 3
[] change = inf to -> inf
