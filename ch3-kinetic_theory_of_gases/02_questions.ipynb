    "   where $N_V$ is the number of molecules per unit volume and $\\overline{E_k}$ is the average kinetic energy of a molecule. By relating this expression to the pressure obtained from the ideal gas law, what can be concluded about the energy per degree of freedom in an ideal gas? (5)\n",

    "3. Consider a gas that is raised from temperature $T_C$ to $T_H$. This process is conducted either at constant pressure or at constant volume. By considering these two processes, show that the ratio of the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure $c_p$ and constant volume $c_V$ of an ideal gas is equal to $5/3$. (5)\n",

The pressure in the two systems is reduced by a factor of two, allowing the systems to expand, one adiabatically and one isothermally. What are the final temperatures and volumes of each system?
