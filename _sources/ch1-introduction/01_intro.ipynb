    "\n",
    "In thermal physics, we deal with enormous numbers of atoms and molecules. These large numbers make it impossible to track individual particles, so we describe their behaviour statistically, in terms of averages. Even numbers we think of as huge, like the Earth’s population (~$10^9$) or the U.S. national debt (~$10^{13}$), are tiny compared with the numbers of atoms in ordinary matter (around $10^{23}-10^{25}$ per sample). For instance, 1 kg of nitrogen gas contains about $2*10^{25}$ molecules. A fast computer counting one molecule per clock cycle would take hundreds of millions of years just to count them! To handle such vast quantities, we use the concept of the mole, a convenient counting unit similar to a \"dozen\", but much larger.\n",

In the ideal limit, the path consists of an infinite sequence of equilibrium states, so that the state variables are well defined at every stage of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **irreversible** path involves changes that drive the system away from equilibrium such that they can no longer be described by state variables. Consider the rapid compression of a gas with a piston, vigorous stirring, or expansion into a vacuum. During such processes, different parts of the system may not be in equilibrium with one another. As a result, state variables cannot describe the system throughout the process, and the path itself cannot be specified in terms of these variables.\n",
