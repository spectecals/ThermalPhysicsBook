    "1. What are the four laws of thermodynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An ideal heat engine operates reversibly between a hot reservoir at temperature T_H=600 K and a cold reservoir at temperature T_C=300 K. What is its maximum possible efficiency?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the mass of 3 moles of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)? (1 mole of oxygen atoms has a mass of 16 g.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A typical bacterium has a mass of 10<sup>−12</sup> g. Calculate the mass of a mole of bacteria. (Interestingly,this is about the total number of bacteria living inthe guts of all humans resident on planet Earth.) Give your answer in units of elephant-masses (elephants have a mass ~5000 kg).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are there more water *molecules* in your body (assuming you are 100% water) or more water *droplets* in all the oceans in the world? There is approximately $10^{21}$ kg of water in all of the world's oceans. Use an estimate of the size of a typical droplet of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A system contains $n$ atoms, each of which can only have zero or one quanta of energy. How many ways can you arrange $r$ quanta of energy when:\n",
    "    1. $n=20,\\ r=10$;\n",
    "    2. $n=2*10^{23},\\ r=10^{23}$? (TIP: you'll need to use an [approximation]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation} for large factorials, $\\text{ln } n! = n \\text{ln} n - n + O(n)$, but you can disregard $O(n)$ here)"
