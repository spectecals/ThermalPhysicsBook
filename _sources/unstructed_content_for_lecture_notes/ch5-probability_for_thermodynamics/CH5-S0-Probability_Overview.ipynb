    "Reality is filled with uncertainty. Every action or decision we take must be made with incomplete information, since the chain of events leading to an outcome is often so complex that the exact result is unpredictable. Nevertheless, we can still act with quantifiable confidence in an uncertain world. Incomplete information is better than none at all, for example - it is more useful to know that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow than to have no forecast whatsoever. Probability is the mathematical framework that allows us to quantify uncertainty, and it is ubiquitous across all fields of scientific study, alongside finance sectors, software development, politics and so forth.\n",

    "Probability theory has had an undeniably strong impact in furthering our understanding of thermal physics. This is because we often study systems containing a practically uncountable number of particles, where individual atomic behaviour is unpredictable but collective behaviour is remarkably regular. On macroscopic scales, probabilistic predictions become suitably precise. Measureable quantities such as temperature or pressure emerge as averages over many atomic contribtions. Although each atom behaves differently, and tracking all atoms' individual motions and collisions is an unfeasible feat, the ensemble's average behaviour follows well-defined probability distribitions, allowing us to perceive and model system behaviour without complete knowledge.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Probabilities are non-negative numbers which take values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a given scenario, all possible outcomes of that scenario form a set of events, with each outcome having an associated probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If an outcome is not part of this set, its probability of occurring is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the event is certain, the probability of it occurring is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events are considered 'mutually exclusive' if they cannot occur simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum of probabilities for all mutually exclusive outcomes must equal one for a valid probability distribution."
