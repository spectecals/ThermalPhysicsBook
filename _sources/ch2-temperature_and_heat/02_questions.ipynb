    "1. The world’s power consumption is currently around 20 TW, and growing! (1 TW = 10<sup>12</sup>W.) Burning one ton of crude oil (which is nearly seven barrels worth) produces about 42 GJ (1 GJ= 10<sup>9</sup>J). If the world’s total power needs were to come entirely from burning oil (a large fraction currently does), how much oil would we be burning per second?\n",

Calculate the specific heat capacity of gold and the heat capacity per unit volume. What is the heat capacity of 4×10<sup>6</sup> kg of gold? (This is roughly the holdings of Fort Knox.)\n",
