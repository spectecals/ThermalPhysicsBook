    "### 4.3 Work done during volume changes\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, work is defined generally as energy transferred across a system boundary by any means other than heat. Expressions such as force multiplied by displacement arise as special cases of this definition when analysing mechanical systems, but it can be considered more generally as part of the thermodynamic framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets take the concept of work and apply it to a thermodynamic system (any collection of objects or matter that is conveniently treated as a single unit for analysis, and that may exchange energy with its surroundings).\n",
    "\n",
    "[FIGURE 19.3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple example of a thermodynamics system, a gas enclosed in a cylinder with a moveable piston. This system is coming in engines (e.g. internal combustion) and compressors (e.g. in refrigerators).\n",
    "\n",
    "[FIGURE 19.4]\n",
    "\n",
    "When a system such as a gas changes volume against a moveable piston, it can do work on its surroundings. An expanding gas pushes the piston outward and does positive work, whilst when the piston moves inward and the gas is compressed, work is done on the gas (this can also be thought of as the gas doing negative work). At the molecular level, work only occurs when gas molecules collide with a moving piston, not a stationary wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "[FIGURE 19.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "See the figure above, which shows a system (gas, liquid, solid) in a hollow cylinder with one end enclosed with a moveable piston. The piston has a cross-sectional surface are equivalent to the cylinder ($A$), and the enclosed gas exerts a pressure $p$ on the piston face. The total force exerted on the piston is $F=pA$. If in response to this force the piston moves an infinitesimal distance $dx$, the the work done in this process is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "dW = F \\ dx = pA \\ dx.\n",
    "\\tag{4.11}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $Adx = dV$, where dV is the infinitesimal volume change of the system, the work done by the system in this infinitesimal volume change is simply re-expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dW = p \\ dV.\n",

    "During a volume change, the system pressure generally varies, so evaluating Eq. (4.13) requires knowledge of the pressure-volume relationship $p(V)$. This work is represented graphically on a *pV-diagram* (see Chapter 3) as the area under the $p(V)$ curve between the points $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **expansion** ($V_2 > V_1$, the area is positive and the system does positive work on its surroundings. For a **compression** ($V_2 < V_1$), the area is negative and the system does negative work. In the special case where pressure is constant throughout the whole process, Eq. (4.13) reduces to:\n",

    "### 4.4 Work and heat in a thermodynamic process\n",
    "\n",
    "We now consider how the work performed by a system and the heat transferred to it during a thermodynamic process depend on the specific path and conditions under which the process occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand intuitively how a path can influence the work performed by a system, picture how the difficulty rating of hiking trails which all lead to the same destination can challenge you differently, requiring more or less work on your part depending on the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a thermodynamic system described using pressure and volume ($p$, $V$), evolves from an initial state ($p_1$, $V_1$) to a final state ($p_2$, $V_2$), it passes through a sequence of intermediate equilibrium states called a **path**. Infinitely many paths can connect the same initial and final states on a pV-diagram, in the same manner in which two points on a graph can be connected via infinitely many curves."
