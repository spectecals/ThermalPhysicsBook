    "### 4.3 Work done during volume changes\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, work is defined generally as energy transferred across a system boundary by any means other than heat. Expressions such as force multiplied by displacement arise as special cases of this definition when analysing mechanical systems, but it can be considered more generally as part of the thermodynamic framework.\n",

    "Now lets take the concept of work and apply it to a thermodynamic system (any collection of objects or matter that is conveniently treated as a single unit for analysis, and that may exchange energy with its surroundings).\n",

    "\n",
    "When a system such as a gas changes volume against a moveable piston, it can do work on its surroundings. An expanding gas pushes the piston outward and does positive work, whilst when the piston moves inward and the gas is compressed, work is done on the gas (this can also be thought of as the gas doing negative work). At the molecular level, work only occurs when gas molecules collide with a moving piston, not a stationary wall.\n",

    "See the figure above, which shows a system (gas, liquid, solid) in a hollow cylinder with one end enclosed with a moveable piston. The piston has a cross-sectional surface are equivalent to the cylinder ($A$), and the enclosed gas exerts a pressure $p$ on the piston face. The total force exerted on the piston is $F=pA$. If in response to this force the piston moves an infinitesimal distance $dx$, the the work done in this process is:\n",

    "It may seem obvious to us today that heat and work represent forms of transient energy, but this understanding came about over a period of gradual discoveries. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, heat was not initially regarded as a form of energy at all. Instead, it was treated as a material substance. The eventual recognition of heat and work as equivalent forms of energy was a major conceptual breakthrough that laid the foundation for the modern interpretation of thermodynamics.\n",

Therefore, in adiabatic processes the changes is temperature are brought about entirely through work, and not by heat transfer. Practically speaking, this can be achieved through sufficient system isolation; or by completing the process sufficiently quick such that heat does not have enough time to flow:\n",

    "During adiabatic expansion, the volume of the system is increased without allowing for heat transfer. Expansion means work done is being done by the system, which can be interpreted as negative work done on the system. Therefore the change in internal energy is negative and the temperature is typically also reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "During adiabatic compression, the volume of the system decreases without allowing for heat transfer. Compression means that the work done on the system is positive; hence the change in internal energy reflects this which typically corresponds to an increase in the system's temperature.\n",

    "##### 2 - Isobaric Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "An **isobaric** process is one in which the **pressure remains constant**. Such processes commonly occur when a gas is allowed to expand or contract against a constant external pressure; consider a gas beneath a freely moving piston, or boiling water exposed to atmospheric pressure.\n",

For a process to remain isothermal, heat must flow into or out of the system slowly enough that thermal equilibrium with the surroundings is maintained at all times. In practice, this requires good thermal contact with a heat reservoir and quasi-static motion of the piston.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many systems, internal energy depends on both temperature and volume. However, for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. Therefore in an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, $\\Delta U = 0$. This is a special but extremely important case.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a free expansion, a gas expands into a vacuum inside an insulated container. No heat enters or leaves the system and the gas does no work: $Q = W = 0$ thus $\\Delta U = 0$. Does the temperature of the gas change?\n",

    "Suppose that the temperature *did* change during free expansion whilst the internal energy stayed constant. We would then have to conlcude that the internal energy depends not only on temperature $T$, but also on volume $V$ or pressure $p$. However, experiments show that for a low-density (ideal) gas, the temperature does not change during free expansion, despite the fact that $V$ and $p$ do. This leads us to a crucial conclusion:\n",

    "> **For an ideal gas, the internal energy, $U$, depends only on temperature $T$, not on pressure or volume.**\n",

For non-ideal gases, experiments do show a temperature change during free expansion despite an unchanging internal energy ($\\Delta U = 0$). This means that internal energy cannot entirely depend on temperature; it must also depend on pressure and/or volume. Considering the microscopic reality of gases, this result is not surprising. Non-ideal gases have intermoleculer forces; as molecules move further apart from each other during expansion the experience an increase in their potential energies. If total internal energy remains constant the kinetic energy must drop accordingly - corresponding to a drop in temperature."
