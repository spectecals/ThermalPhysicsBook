    "The behavior of matter and its dependence on temperature can be observed in everyday situations. For example, boiling water produces high-pressure steam, and a potato can burst in the oven if steam cannot escape. Water vapour in the air may condense or even freeze on a very cold glass. These examples illustrate macroscopic properties of matter such as pressure, volume, temperature, and mass. However, matter can also be described from a microscopic perspective, in terms of the masses, speeds, energies, and collisions of the individual molecules that it is composed of. Importantly, the macroscopic and microscopic views are closely connected. For instance, atmospheric pressure is the result of countless air molecules striking surfaces at high speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the state of a gas we use state variables; pressure ($p$), volume ($V$), temperature ($T$), and amount of substance (often expressed as moles, $n$). Changing one of these variables usually affects the others. When the relationship between these variables can be written mathematically, we call it an equation of state. One of the simplest and most important of these is the [ideal gas equation we covered in section 1](sec:idealgas), which applies well when gas molecules are far apart and moving rapidly (low pressure and high temperature).

These curves are called **isotherms**. Using the ideal gas law $p=nRT/V$, we see that along an isotherm the temperature is fixed, so pressure is inversely proportional to volume.
