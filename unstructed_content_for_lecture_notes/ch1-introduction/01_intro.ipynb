    "## What is a mole?\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermal physics, we deal with enormous numbers of atoms and molecules. These large numbers make it impossible to track individual particles, so we describe their behaviour statistically, in terms of averages. Even numbers we think of as huge, like the Earth’s population (~$10^9$) or the U.S. national debt (~$10^{13}$), are tiny compared with the numbers of atoms in ordinary matter (around $10^{23}-10^{25}$ per sample). For instance, 1 kg of nitrogen gas contains about $2*10^{25}$ molecules. A fast computer counting one molecule per clock cycle would take hundreds of millions of years just to count them! To handle such vast quantities, we use the concept of the mole, a convenient counting unit similar to a \"dozen\", but much larger.\n",

    "A mole is the quantity of matter that contains as many objects (atoms, molecules, ions) as there are atoms in *exactly* 12 grams of $^{12}$C.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This number, called **Avogadro’s number**, is $N_A=6.022×10^{23}$. Thus, one mole of carbon, water, or sodium chloride each contains $6.022×10^{23}$ of their respective particles."
