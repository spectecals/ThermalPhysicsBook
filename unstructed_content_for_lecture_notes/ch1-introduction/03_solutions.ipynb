    "CO<sub>2</sub> has atomic numbers $Z = 12, 16$. The definition of the mole is the number of atoms required such that our carbon-12 weighs 12g, therefore we don't need to use Avagadro's number or find the weight of a singular molecule. \n",

Give your answer in units of elephant-masses (elephants have a mass ~5000 kg).\n",

We're starting to approach the regime where we might need to use [tetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers#Standardized_system_of_writing) just in order to represent it. Doing math in this sort of regime is simply not feasible, no computer can perform this operation. It would require over $10^{22}$ digits which is just about manageable if we were able to use all the digital storage on the planet (the International Data Corporation's estimate of the total digital storage that will be manufactured in 2025 is only 22 ZB, or $22 \\cdot 10^{21}$, so we'll need to borrow some more from the previous years too).

For $n=10^{23}$, the relative error is on the order of $10^{-25}$, i.e. the *absolute* error will have $10^{22} - 25$ digits.
