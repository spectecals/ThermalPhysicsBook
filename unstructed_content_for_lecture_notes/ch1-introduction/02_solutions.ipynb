    "CO<sub>2</sub> has atomic numbers $Z = 12, 16$. The definition of the mole is the number of atoms required such that our carbon-12 weighs 12g, therefore we don't need to use Avagadro's number or find the weight of a singular molecule. \n",

Give your answer in units of elephant-masses (elephants have a mass ~5000 kg).\n",

    "Here we do require Avagadro's number, $6.022 * 10 ^(23)$, and it will help to write the elephant masses in the form of $5 * 10^3\\  \\text{kg}=5 * 10^6\\ \\text{g} = 1\\ \\text{g}/ 2*10^{-7}$.\n",
