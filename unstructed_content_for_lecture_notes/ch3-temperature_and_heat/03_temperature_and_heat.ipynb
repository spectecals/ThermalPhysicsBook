    "## Heat\n",
    "\n",
    "We all have an intuitive idea of what heat is. While sitting near a fire in winter or standing in the sun, we feel the warmth increasing our temperature, or conversely touching a cold snowball makes our hand feel cool as heat leaves it. From these observations, we understand heat as a form of energy transfer between objects at different temperatures. Heat represents energy moving from one body to another because of a temperature difference, not something an object possesses by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Definition:\n",
    ":class: definition\n",
    "Heat is thermal energy in transit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat flows spontaneously from a warmer body to a cooler one, though on a microscopic level, both bodies exchange energy with each other. The net energy transfer, or *heat flow*, is therefore from the warmer body to the cooler one. However, this direction can be reversed if external energy is supplied, such as in a refrigerator or freezer, where electrical power forces heat to move from the cold interior to the warmer surroundings. Thus, the definition of heat focuses on transfer itself, without assuming a specific direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase “in transit” is important because while you can add heat to an object, you cannot say the object contains heat. Heat cannot be stored or measured directly like fuel in a tank. It only exists while energy is being transferred. What an object actually contains is internal energy, which can change through heating or doing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can warm your cold hands by holding them near a fire (adding heat) or by rubbing them together (doing work). In both cases, their temperature rises, showing that both heat and work increase internal energy."

    "### Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we do not give heat a direction, we instead need to designate bodies or *systems* that heat is transferred to or from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we adopt the sign convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heat added is positive ($Q > 0$)\n",
    "- Heat removed is negative ($Q < 0$)\n",

    "Heat is measured in **joules (J)**, and the **rate of heating** is measured in **watts (W)** where **1 W = 1 J/s**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, work holds the usual meaning of energy entering (or leaving) a system, though with the caveat that this does not include thermal energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When work is done *on* a system, energy is entering that system and the internal energy goes up, usually in the form of an increase in temperature.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When work is done *by* a system, energy is leaving that system and entering another.**\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Total heat released\" refers to heat entering the environment, therefore our 'system' is the environment and 'Q' is positive. The dryer performed 450kJ of work *on* the environment by converting its electrical energy to thermal energy, or *heat*. \n",

    "In the previous section, we defined heat as energy in transit. We now consider how this heat affects the internal energy of the system, and how much must be added to an object to raise its temperature. The relationship between the amount of heat supplied and the resulting temperature change is described by the heat capacity."
