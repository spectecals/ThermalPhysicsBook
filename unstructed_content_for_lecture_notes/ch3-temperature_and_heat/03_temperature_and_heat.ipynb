    "## Heat\n",
    "\n",
    "We all have an intuitive idea of what heat is. While sitting near a fire in winter or standing in the sun, we feel the warmth increasing our temperature, or conversely touching a cold snowball makes our hand feel cool as heat leaves it. From these observations, we understand heat as a form of energy transfer between objects at different temperatures. Heat represents energy moving from one body to another because of a temperature difference, not something an object possesses by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Definition:\n",
    ":class: definition\n",
    "Heat is thermal energy in transit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat flows spontaneously from a warmer body to a cooler one, though on a microscopic level, both bodies exchange energy with each other. The net energy transfer, or *heat flow*, is therefore from the warmer body to the cooler one. However, this direction can be reversed if external energy is supplied, such as in a refrigerator or freezer, where electrical power forces heat to move from the cold interior to the warmer surroundings. Thus, the definition of heat focuses on transfer itself, without assuming a specific direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase “in transit” is important because while you can add heat to an object, you cannot say the object contains heat. Heat cannot be stored or measured directly like fuel in a tank. It only exists while energy is being transferred. What an object actually contains is internal energy, which can change through heating or doing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can warm your cold hands by holding them near a fire (adding heat) or by rubbing them together (doing work). In both cases, their temperature rises, showing that both heat and work increase internal energy."

    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we defined heat as energy in transit. We now consider how this heat affects the internal energy of the system, and how much must be added to an object to raise its temperature. The relationship between the amount of heat supplied and the resulting temperature change is described by the heat capacity.\n",

To compare different materials, it is often more useful to express heat capacity **per unit mass**. This is called the **specific heat capacity**, where $c = C / m$, measured in units of Jkg<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>.\n",

Consider something traditionally dense like lead -- its specific heat capacity is only 129 Jkg<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>! Even diamond has a specific heat much lower at 51 Jkg<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful quantity is the molar heat capacity, or the heat capacity per mole of substance. For water, whose molar mass is 18 gmol<sup>-1</sup>, the molar heat capacity is found by multiplying the specific heat capacity by the molar mass: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C*m = 4.18 * 103\\text{ Jkg}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1} * 0.018\\text{ kgmol}^{-1} = 75.2\\text{ Jmol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}.$$\n",

    "## The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of thermal equilibrium is very important to understand for describing how thermometers work. When two objects at different temperatures are placed in thermal contact, energy (in the form of heat, as we discussed above) flows from the hotter body to the colder body until equilibrium is reached. Heat is defined as energy in transit due to a temperature difference. This process continues until no net heat flow occurs between the two bodies. At this point, the objects have the same temperature, and are said to be in thermal equilibrium. It is very important to realise that the reverse process would not occur, as there is an arrow of time tending towards equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term thermalisation is defined as the process leading to thermal equilibrium. When bodies are thermalised (or in thermal equilibrium), you would expect that they have the same temperature. This is the implication behind the *zeroth law of thermodynamics*:\n",

    "Conduction is the transfer of heat through a material in contact. It depends on the motion of particles that carry energy from one region to another. When one end of a metal rod is placed in a flame, the other end soon becomes hot because energy is transmitted alongthe rod by molecular and electronic collisions. The rate of heat flow through a material is proportional to the temperature difference and inversely proportional to the length through which the heat flows. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Convection\n",
    "\n",
    "Convection is the transfer of heat by the mass motion of a fluid from one region to another. Examples include hot-air and hot-water heating systems, the cooling system of a car engine, and the circulation of blood in the body. There exists two types of convection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Natural (free) convection*: where motion arises from density differences caused by temperature gradients. As warmer fluids become less dense, cooler fluids sink and heat is transferred.\n",
    "- *Forced convection*: where motion is imposed by an external mechanism, i.e. a pump, fan or some form of mechanical movement. The movement of the fluid in this case is not driven by density or buoyancy, and instead by mechanical work applied to the system.\n",

    "### Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiation transfers heat by electromagnetic waves such as infrared and visible light. It occurs even through a vacuum, as in heat from the Sun or a fire. All objects emit radiation depending on temperature: mainly infrared at room temperature, red-hot at 800°C, and white-hot near 3000°C, with the following rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = Ae\\sigma T^4 $$\n",

    "- $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\n",
    "- and $T$ is the absolute temperature of the surface.\n",

    "You should check for unit consistency in the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Emissivity ($e$) is often larger for dark surfaces than light ones. The emissivity of a smooth copper surface is about 0.3, but $e$ for a dull black surface can be close to unity."
