    "1. What is the mass of 3 moles of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A typical bacterium has a mass of 10<sup>−12</sup> g. Calculate the mass of a mole of bacteria. (Interestingly,this is about the total number of bacteria living in the guts of all humans resident on planet Earth.) Give your answer in units of elephant-masses (elephants have a mass ~5000 kg).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are there more water *molecules* in your body (assuming you are 100% water) or more water *droplets* in all the oceans in the world? There is approximately $10^{21}$ kg of water in all of the world's oceans. Use an estimate of the size of a typical droplet of water.\n",

    "4. A system contains $n$ atoms, each of which can only have zero or one quanta of energy. How many ways can you arrange $r$ quanta of energy when:\n",
    "    1. $n=20,\\ r=10$;\n",
    "    2. $n=2*10^{23},\\ r=10^{23}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A gas is in thermal equilibrium prior to being compressed. What is the \"type\" of the variables that change, and what are 3 examples of those variables? What must be satisfied in order to describe these variables after the compression, and how do these variables change?"
