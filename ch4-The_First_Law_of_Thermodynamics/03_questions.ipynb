    "# Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics - Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Some questions present have been re-utilized from the *Thermal Physics* or *University Physics with Modern Physics* textbooks. Whenever this is the case, we will specify beside the question via:\n",

    "- Thermal Physics $\\rightarrow$ TP ChapterNumber.QuestionNumber\n",
    "- University Physics with Modern Physics $\\rightarrow$ UPMP ChapterNumber.QuestionNumber\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to explore the additional questions and examples present in the chapters proposed in the recommended reading. We advise that you have an earnest effort of solving the questions yourself before looking at the solutions, resorting to solving in an open-book manner before looking at the solutions.\n",

    "## Question 1 - Cloud Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain why cloud formation on top of a mountain is ana example of an adiabatic process. In your answer, make reference to the significance of the partial and vapour pressures of water.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Question 2 - Gas Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal gas undergoes a compression from $V_1$ to $V_2$ that is either isothermal or adiabatic. For each case, what is the work done by the gas and how does the internal energy change? (No number crunching is required).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3 - Increasing the temperature of a gas\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature of an ideal gas is raised from $T_c$ to $T_h$ ($T_c < T_h$). This is done in one of two ways: either at constant pressure, or at constant volume. Indicate these two paths on a pV-diagram.\n",

    "## Question 4 - Isothermal Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system that undergoes an isothermal expansion from volume $V_1$ to volume $V_2$ where $V_2 = 2V_1$. If $V_1$ = 1 L, $T$ = 300 K and $n$ = 1 mol, calculate the work done on the system.\n",

    "## Question 5 - Isothermal Expansion (TP 11.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "One mole of ideal monatomic gas is confined in a cylinder by a piston and is maintained at a constant temperature $T_0$ by thermal contact with a heat reservoir. The gas slowly expands from $V_1$ to $V_2$ while being held at the same temperature $T_0$. Why does the internal energy of the gas not change? Calculate the work done by the gas and the heat flow into the gas.\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure below shows a pV-diagram for a cyclic process in which the initial and final states of some thermodynamic system are the same. The state of the system starts at point $a$ and proceeds counterclockwise in the pV-diagram to point $b$, then back to $a$; the total work is $W = -500 \\ \\text{J}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "One gram of water ($1 \\ \\text{cm}^3$) becomes $1671 \\ \\text{cm}^3$ of steam when boiled at a constant pressure of 1 atm ($1.013 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{Pa}$). The heat of vaporization at this pressure is $L_v = 2.256 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1}$.\n",
