    "This chapter introduces the **first law of thermodynamics**, the central bookkeeping principle that governs all thermal processes. At its core, the first law expresses energy conservation for thermodynamic systems, linking changes in a system's internal energy to energy transferred by **heat** and **work**. Throughout the chapter, we will sharpen our definitions of heat, work and internal energy, establishing clear sign conventions used in subsequent derivations. This notational framework will allow us to analyse physical processes consistently, regardless of the complexity of the path between states.\n",

We then examine **heat capacities**, showing how they quantify a system's response to heating and lead naturally to the gas constant $R$ and the adiabatic index $\\gamma$. These ideas culminate in the derivation of the **adiabatic equation of state**, $pV^{\\gamma} = \\text{const}$, revealing how microscopic energy storage shapes macroscopic gas behaviour.\n",

    "## 4.1 Review: Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The conservation of energy is fundamental to thermodynamics because it governs how energy is transferred and transformed within a system. It provides the basis for the first law of thermodynamics, which relates changes in internal energy to heat added to a system and work done by the system. By applying energy conservation, we can distinguish between energy stored internally and energy exchanged as work or heat, enabling a consistent understanding of thermodynamic processes and their limits.\n",

    "### Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Work is done by exerting a force on an object, whilst the object is moved from one position to another (or has its shape warped). There is a displacement of the object (see figure below):\n",
    "\n",
    "[FIGURE 6.2 HERE]\n",
    "\n",
    "Work measures the energy transferred by a force acting through a process of displacement. When an object moves a distance $s$ in a straight line under a constant force $F$ which acts in the same direction as the displacement, the work done is calculated to be simply the product of $F$ and $s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = F s\n",
    "\\tag{4.1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{[Joules, J]} = \\text{[Newtons, N]} \\cdot \\text{[Displacement, m]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the equation above we can see that work can be increased by amplifying the force or by applying the same force over a greater distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sign of work:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of the work depends on the relative angle of the force to the object that is being displaced. The figure below helps to illustrate how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "[FIGURE 6.3 HERE]\n",
    "\n",
    "With vector representations for the quantities involved, $\\vec{F}$ & $\\vec{s}$ we can produce two other equivalent statements for work:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = |\\vec{F}||\\vec{s}| \\ \\cos(\\phi) = Fs \\ \\cos(\\phi),\n",
    "\\tag{4.2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is the angle between $\\vec{F}$ and $\\vec{s}$. If $\\phi=0$, so that $\\vec{F}$ and $\\vec{s}$ act in the same direction, then $\\cos(\\phi)=1$ and we regain Eq. (4.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Eq. (4.2) has the form of a *scalar product* of two vectors, meaning it can be equivalently represented as a dot product of two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{s}.\n",
    "\\tag{4.3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Work can take any real value, from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, but it is a *scalar* quantity: it has magnitude but no intrinsic direction. This is true despite work being defined in terms of vector quantities. A 5 N force acting eastward on an object that then moves 6 m east does the same amount of work as a 5 N force acting northward on an object which then moves 6 m north.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of the work encodes the direction of energy transfer between the system and its surroundings. Once a sign convention is fixed, positive and negative values of work correspond to different physical situations. In this convention, positive work represents energy transferred to the system by the surroundings, while negative work represents energy transferred from the system to the surroundings. The mathematical form of the first law remains unchanged; only the interpretation of the sign differs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The total work done on an object by external forces is linked to its displacement, but its physical importance lies in how it changes the object's speed. Work is positive when the net force has a component in the direction of motion, negative when it opposes the motion, and zero when the net force lies perpendicular to the displacement (or when no force is applied, of course).\n",
