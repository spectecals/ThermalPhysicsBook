    "$\\underline{\\text{Conservation forces:}}$ The work done by a conservative force has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be written as the difference between the final and initial values of a potential energy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The work is reversible: reversing the motion reverses the sign of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The work is independent of the parth taken and depends only on the starting and ending points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The total work done over any closed path is zero. (A closed path is a path that returns to its initial state.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When only conservative forces do work, the total mechanical energy ($E=K+U$) is conserved. Examples include the gravitational force, spring force and the electric force.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underline{\\text{Nonconservative forces:}}$ Not all forces are conservative. Friction and fluid resistance do negative work regardless of the direction of motion, so the work done over a closed path is not zero and the lost kinetic energy cannot be recovered; hence, mechanical energy is not conserved and no potential energy can be defined for these forces. Such forces are categorised as being **nonconservative**, and many are **dissipative**, converting mechanical energy into other forms. Some nonconservative forces, like explosive or chemical forces, can increase mechanical energy in irreversible processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, nonconservative forces can either dissipate mechanical energy (like friction) or generate mechanical energy by converting other forms of energy (like chemical potential) into motion - in both cases, the process cannot be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underline{\\text{Conservation of Energy:}}$ Non-conservative forces, such as friction, cannot be described by a potential energy function. However, their effects do not violate the law of conservation of energy. To account for them, we introduce the concept of **internal energy**, denoted, $U_{int}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal energy is the energy associated with the microscopic motion and interactions of the particles which make up a system. Increasing the temperature of a system increases its internal energy; decreasing the temperature lowers it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system on which friction does negative work, such as a block sliding across a rough surface. The system slows down, so its kinetic energy decreases. However, experiments show that this \"lost\" mechanical energy has not disappeared. Instead, it is converted into internal energy and its surroundings. Quantitatively, this is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta U_{int} = -W_{other},\n",
    "\\tag{4.8}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_{other}$ is the work done by non-conservative forces (such as friction) and $\\Delta U_{int}$ is the resulting change in internal energy. We can now write the total energy of the system as the sum of its kinetic energy $K$, potential energy $P$, and internal energy $U_{int}$. The law of the conservation of energy requires that the total energy remains constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K_1 + P_1 + U_{int,1} = K_2 + P_2 + U_{int,2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging and rewriting this in terms of differentials (e.g. $\\Delta K - K_2 - K_1$) explicitly yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta K + \\Delta P + \\Delta U_{int} = 0.\n",
    "\\tag{4.9}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the general statement of energy conservation: although energy may be transferred between kinetic, potential and internal forms, the total energy of a closed system is conserved. A useful consequence follows immediately; if no energy is transferred into internal energy (for example, when only conservative forces act) then $\\Delta U_{int} = 0$, and the familiar result\n",

    "\\Delta K + \\Delta P = 0\n",
