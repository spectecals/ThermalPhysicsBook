    "As air rises over a mountain, it moves into a region of lower atmospheric pressure. The air parcel expands as it rises and, in doing so, does work on its surroundings. During this process, the air is not in meaningful thermal contact with the mountain or its surroundings, so no heat is being transferred as it ascends the mountain. Therefore, we can treat this circumstance as an adiabatic process ($Q = 0$).\n",

As the air cools, the vapour pressure of the water decreases. Once the vapour pressure drops below the partial pressure threshold, the water vapour must condense into liquid droplets. These droplets form clouds, which is why cloud formation often occurs near the tops of mountains.\n",
